Convert question to SQL query: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
Execute SQL query: Execute the query.
Answer the question: Model responds to user input using the query results.

at most {top_k} results. You can order the results by a relevant column to
return the most interesting examples in the database.

Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the
few relevant columns given the question.

Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema
description. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also,
pay attention to which column is in which table.
